                            <h2> AutoTaxi-System</h2>
                                <p></p>In groups of 7 we were given an assignment to create any system we want,we came with
                
                                AUTO TAXI is a taxi industry-based software system which provides help to taxi passengers to find a 
                                taxi in a respective taxi rank to their destination. The software consists of registered routes which 
                                taxis uses from one rank to another to their end destination, therefore on its duty of commuting 
                                passengers, at first a user of the AUTO TAXI will gain access by logging in then navigate through the 
                                system according to the taxi rank she/he is in and find all the information about the taxis operations, 
                                and she will find all places that the taxis in that taxi rank transport passengers, and she/he will 
                                choose where he/she is heading. Then passengers will indicate his/her spot of being dropped off 
                                through the street’s names or any recognizable location through the AUTO TAXI software in line with 
                                the route of a taxi.</p>
                
                
                
                
                
                
                                <p>A taxi driver is one of the users too where he/she must through the system sign in his personal 
                                credentials, even of the taxi he/she is driving, like registration number and color of the taxi. The taxi 
                                driver will activate his/her turn on a line of commuting passengers with the spot in a taxi rank where 
                                he/she is parked for passenger can easily identify the taxi. Therefore, after a passenger(s) find a taxi, 
                                she/he will identify his/her drop off spot and the taxi driver will receive a message of passenger(s) 
                                on where to be drop off on a registered route, of which there is a reminder to the taxi driver when 
                                the taxi has reached the spot for a passenger to get off the taxi when it has arrived or reached the 
                                spot identified of the passenger.</p>
                
                
                
                
                
                               <p> It evens support paying taxi fare through the system; therefore, it identifies the passenger who paid 
                                through the system to the taxi driver through the spot of being dropped of , as a measure of 
                                assurance of valid payment made.
                                The AUTO TAXI aims to optimes the way we deal with mobility and make travelling more 
                                sustainable and efficient. AUTO TAXI provide solution on convenience public transport, smooth 
                                electronic fare transactions, travel time improvement and reductions in delays at intersections. It 
                                reduces even the case of being lost when looking for direction at times with misunderstanding when 
                                asking people about taxis operations. One of the main benefits is enhancing the safety and quality of 
                                life for everyone in urban, even rural areas. Overall, intelligent mobility’s main benefits include 
                                better safety, accessibility, and sustainability of transportation systems</p>

                <p></p>The current situation is that when people want to go somewhere they need transport, most people use taxis. The issue is normally overload, change when people have paid and time waisted when the driver takes different routes searching for other people. 
                Each request made with a smart device leads to an early transport, correct route at the right time and no payment issues.</p> 
                
                
                <h1>OBECTIVE USERS OF THE SYSTEM 
                
                
                IFindTaxi System is a project is aimed at assisting passengers with finding taxi ranks and taxis to their respective desired destination. With just the click of finger any individual can access the software before they can travel to find the nearest taxi rank to wherever they want to go, prices are even displayed in respective of where one want to travel to. Firstly, a passenger will through the software in a taxi rank search to wherever they want to go after finding the nearest taxi rank to an extent of finding where the taxi is located inside the taxi rank line, and they can even pay through the software. It includes taxi drivers too as they play a role of registering their taxi credentials in the system and activating a taxi when it is their turn to commute passengers, so that a passenger can see an active taxi inside the IFindTaxi software as explained above. The primary objective of is for a IFindTaxi passenger to identify the spot of their destination where they want to be dropped off in line with a registered route taxis uses regularly, because in most cases people struggle with drop off spot due to communication misunderstandings of a taxi driver and a passenger.

                I Katlego Serumula, a DSO34BT student in group F, contributed my best towards pitching the Concept of our system, drafting ERD rough sketch, functional requirements, database scripts and assigning duties to group members. 
                
                1.	27 July 2022 
                We meet in class and start knowing each other as group members, pitched few ideas which we rejected and after a group WhatsApp was created. 
                2.	27 July 2022 
                A teams meeting was created for us to meet online and discuss the way forward and brainstormed on how to come up with other system ideas. 
                3.	28 July 2022 
                We meet physically and pitched the idea of finding a taxi in the station and it was accepted.  
                4.	06 August 2022 
                We reviewed the posted on Brightspace and assigned tasks amongst group members. 
                5.	17 August 2022 
                We meet at campus to discuss and present our tasks amongst each other to see they are according to the standards of the rubric.
